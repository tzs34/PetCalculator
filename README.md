# PetCalculator

# A basic React application which acts as a calculator to find out how much a pet would cost to won.
## The application uses React v16, styled components and the React context API.

##To run the application.

1. Clone the repository (by mistake I ommitted node-modules from my .gitignore file, so the required dependencies are already present)
2. Run yarn dev 
3. The application should open in a browser window http://localhost:8080/
